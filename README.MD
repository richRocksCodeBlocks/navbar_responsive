# Responsive Navbar
This is my attempt at a simple, responsive navigation bar using HTML, CSS, CSS Flex Box & JavaScript.
 
It does not rely upon any frameworks such as jQuery Bootstrap, Materialize, etc.
 
This particular version utilizes work from the following projects.  

* [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
* [HTM5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
